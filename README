barvinok is a library for counting the number of integer points
in parametric and non-parametric polytopes as well as projections
of such sets.
For parametric polytopes the count is represented by either
an explicit function or a generating function.
The first comes in the shape of a piece-wise step-polynomial.
This is a generalization of both Ehrhart quasi-polynomials
and vector partition functions.
The second is a generalization of an Ehrhart series.

This library shares some functionality with LattE
(http://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~latte/)
and uses PolyLib (included), PIP (included), NTL (http://shoup.net/ntl/)
and optionally Omega (included).
If you have cloned the git repository, you need to run
	git submodule init
	git submodule update
	sh autogen.sh
to get the submodules and create the configure scripts.

Additionally, the following packages can optionally be used
- GLPK (http://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/)
- GiNaC (http://www.ginac.de/) (needed for the bernstein library)

NTL needs to have been compiled with GMP support.
That is, you have to specify
    NTL_GMP_LIP=on

Suppose you want to put everything in /opt,
Then you configure/compile NTL using

cd src
./configure NTL_GMP_LIP=on PREFIX=/opt GMP_PREFIX=/path/to/gmp
make
make install

Configure this library using

./configure --prefix=/opt --with-libgmp=/path/to/gmp  --with-ntl=/opt

If you want shared libraries, then configure with the
--enable-shared-barvinok option.
Note that this doesn't work on some systems because we link in libntl, which
is only available as a static library.
Also note that if you have previously installed a shared library of an older
version of barvinok, and you do not install one for this version, then the
linker may pick up the old shared library rather than the new static library.

If you don't want to compile and use Omega, then configure with
the --without-omega option.

Then

make
make check
make install

If you want to put any one of these packages in the default location
(typically /usr/local), then the prefix argument can be omitted.
For more information on other arguments,

./configure --help

The input format of barvinok_enumerate is the same as that
of testehrhart from the PolyLib distribution.
See the PolyLib manual, barvinok_enumerate.c or the
examples in tests/ehrhart/ .

Note that the fractional representation is subject to change.

The library supports three specialization algorithms.
The first performs a direct specialization using a random vector.
The second performs a "depth-first" incremental specialization.
The third performs a "breadth-first" incremental specialization.

The first is usually the fastest, but can fail if the random
vector happens to be chosen incorrectly.
The incremental algorithms should never fail, but can be slower,
in some cases by quite a bit.  The breadth-first version should
be faster than the depth-first version, especially on polytopes
of moderate dimension with a lot of "structure", but can require
more memory.
